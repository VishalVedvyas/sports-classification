# sports-classification

Implemented transfer learning using pre-trained models (EfficientNetB0 and VGG16) for multi-class image and video classification of 5 sports. Employed data augmentation techniques, ReLU activation, softmax layer, batch normalization, and dropout. Trained networks for 50-100 epochs, applied early stopping, and evaluated models based on precision, recall, and F1 score.
